# Clash Royale Deck Generator

## What is it?
It's a deck generator that can help you decide and choose your best deck composition based on stats.
You can generate a random deck of cards or you can build your own.
And finally you can have a shareable link whether for the random deck or for the one you built.

## How to use?
It's simple, you have main three buttons (Generate, Build Custom Deck and Copy sharebale link)

The **Generate** will get you a random set of cards of which you can find the Average Elixit cost, or you can know more if you click on the small Elixir drop about the 4-Cards Cycle, Types and Rarity.

The **Build Custom Deck** will open a popup containing all possible cards grouped by rarity to choose from and finally hit submit or reset depending on your choice.

The **Copy Shareable Link** will copy a link into your clipboard so you can send it to someone else to check you own deck of cards or a random one you layed your hand one.

You can in any time mute the music by hitting the volume sign on the top left.
